# MDP-Agent
The purpose of this assignment is to gain an understanding of the purpose and creation of Markov Decision Processes. An MDP is an augmented version of a Markov chain (a belief network with random variables in a sequence where each variable only directly depends on its predecessor in the sequence) which includes potential actions and rewards as nodes (Poole & Mackworth, 2017). In this assignment the following scenario will be modeled and implemented in the Java language.
